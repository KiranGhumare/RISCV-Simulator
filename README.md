Make sure to place testcase folder (containing imem.txt and dmem.txt) in the
data folder as the python code main.py file and run the main function in
RISC-V
_
Simulator.py using the below command:

python3 main.py --iodir <path-to-testcases-input>/testcase0

Output files will be generated under the same input/testcase folder. Performance
metric files are also created as part of output files, these can also be seen in the
terminal.
